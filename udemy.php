					<p class="well">
					I finished Udemy course on <a href="http://www.udemy.com/learn-backbonejs-stackmob/#/">"Learn Backbone.js"</a> which was a pretty good introductory course in learning web application framework using Backbone.js. Backbone has been very popular lately, especially since the introduction of Nodje.js. In this course "Learn Backbone.js," the instructor Sydney Maestre deployed a Backbone.js application on Python StackMob server that ran Node.js. I recommend this course to anyone who is intersted in getting to know Backbone and curious about how this framework can build simple application with Javascript. This course assumes that the students already have some experience programming in Javascript as well as basic understanding of how web application works. However, you don't need to know the MVC design model because this course has very good explanation on how MVC works with Backbone. There are handouts available as zip files and you can work with the code while watching the tutorial videos. I liked how the instrutor deployed a web application and toured all folders and files that make the application run in MVC design. This course is a good intro to Backbone web application, and recommended to those who might want to get started on Backbone.js in short period of time.
